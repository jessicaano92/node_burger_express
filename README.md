# node_burger_express

## Description
This burger application allows for the user to input a type of burger and click on a "Add Burger" button to add it to the "To Be Devoured List". The burger then populates under this list with optional buttons. They then have the option to "DEVOUR!" it in which their chosen burger shows up under the "Burgers That Are Devoured!" header. 
I built this application with trying to understand how MySQL and Handlebars works along with the different file structure we have now started building. Connecting each file to each other in order for them to communicate was difficult. Along with understanding how MySQL and Handlebars works. 
Difficulties I came across include: functionality of event listeners, handlebars, and communication between files and also styling. I, at one point, had the "DEVOUR!" button working but unfortunately it is no longer working.
